## 2.6.0 - 2023-07-07
### Added
* Weeder now supports GHC 9.6.
### Changed
* Weeder now uses [TOML](https://toml.io) as a configuration format. Please see Weeder's `README` for more information on the configuration format.
* Weeder now sorts weeds in a single file by ascending line number
### Fixed
* Weeder now internally adds declarations once. This shouldn't result in any user visible changes, but may improve performance.
