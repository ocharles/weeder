## 2.7.0 - 2023-08-17
### Added
* Weeder now supports type class instances. Type class instances can be marked as roots with the `root-instances` configuration option. (#126, #133, #136)
* Weeder now optionally detects uses of types, excluding type family instances. This can be enabled with the `unused-types` configuration option. (#132)
* Weeder's analysis now runs in parallel. This can almost halve execution time when given enough cores. Enabled by calling Weeder with `-j X` or `-N`. (#137)
* `--write-default-config` flag to write and read a default configuration, if no configuration file is found. (#133)
### Changed
* All configuration options now have default values. This can be disabled with the `--no-default-fields` flag. (#133)
* Weeder will now use distinct exit codes for certain failures. See `README.md` for more details. (#134)
